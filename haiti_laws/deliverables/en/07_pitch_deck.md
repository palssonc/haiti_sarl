# 7) Pitch deck — SARL reform in Haiti

## Slide 1 — The current corporate‑law landscape in Haiti
- Two main forms: SA and limited partnership (commandite)
- Regimes poorly suited to SMEs

**Speaker notes**
- Haiti’s current corporate law is dominated by the SA and the commandite, which create barriers for SMEs.

## Slide 2 — The “missing link” for SMEs
- Accessible limited liability
- Simple governance
- Easier formalization

**Speaker notes**
- SMEs need a limited‑liability form with simple governance and low entry barriers.

---

## Slide 3 — What is a SARL?
- Commercial company with limited liability
- Equity interests and management
- Standardized form for SMEs

**Speaker notes**
- A SARL combines limited liability with simple management suited for small firms.

## Slide 4 — Comparative evidence (OHADA, France, DR)
- SARL as the civil‑law standard
- Compatible regional model
- Need for textual alignment

**Speaker notes**
- The SARL is the standard SME form across civil‑law systems; Haiti can align once primary texts are confirmed.

## Slide 5 — Proposed SARL reform for Haiti
- Creation by law
- Limited liability
- Management and equity interests
