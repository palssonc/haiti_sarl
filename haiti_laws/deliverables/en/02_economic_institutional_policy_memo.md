# 2) Economic & institutional policy memo (Phase 3)

## Purpose
Justify the creation of a Haitian SARL as a legal‑infrastructure reform for SME formalization, access to credit, and the reduction of entrepreneurial risk.

## Institutional assessment (Haitian legal anchoring)

- The Haitian SA provides limited liability to shareholders, but its regime requires administration by agents and, above all, a **presidential authorization** for the constitutive act, which raises the entry barrier for SMEs.【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】
- The société en commandite distinguishes jointly liable managing partners and limited partners who are barred from management under penalty of joint liability, which does not meet the flexible governance needs of family or entrepreneurial SMEs.【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

**Synthesis**: positive law does not offer a small/medium‑size company combining **limited liability + simple governance + accessible incorporation**. The need is therefore institutional, not only economic.【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

## Economic analysis (causal logic)

1. **Reduced personal risk** → encourages formal entrepreneurship.
2. **Structured legal personality** → improves banking access and transaction traceability.
3. **Stable governance rules** → reduces transaction costs and internal conflicts.
4. **Clarity of equity interests** → facilitates entry/exit of minority investors.

These mechanisms do not require a heavy SA, and they are not achieved by the commandite because management often entails unlimited liability (managing partners).【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

## Expected impacts (qualitative)

- **Formalization**: a simple vehicle encourages declaration of activities and registry enrollment.
- **Credit**: asset separation and standardized statutory documentation improve banks’ ability to assess firms.
- **Local investment**: structured equity interests enable local and diaspora investors.
- **Resilience**: clear governance and limited liability reduce bankruptcy costs.

## Institutional risks and mitigation

| Risk | Effect | Mitigation measure |
|---|---|---|
| Administrative capacity deficit | Slows adoption | One‑stop registration, standardized forms |
| Low SME understanding | Statutory errors | Pedagogical campaign and simplified guides |
| Misalignment with existing law | Normative conflicts | Explicit transitional clauses in the law |

## Conclusion

A Haitian SARL, inspired by regional civil‑law models, is an institutional efficiency reform that fills the gap between SA and commandite. The reform should be carried by a **law** (not a decree) to ensure legitimacy and legal stability.
