# 1) Comparative legal synthesis report (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

## Phase 1 — Haitian legal baseline (primary sources only)

### 1.1 Current legal forms in the Haitian Commercial Code (Code de commerce haïtien, 1910)

| Form | Governance (excerpts) | Liability | Capital / securities | Key observations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Société anonyme (SA) | Administered by appointed agents, revocable, associates or not, salaried or unpaid. | Associates are liable only up to the amount of their interest in the company. | Capital divided into shares; bearer or registered shares (registry). | Creation requires authorization by the President of Haiti and approval of the constitutive act. | 
| Société en commandite (SNC/commandite) | One or more general partners jointly liable + limited partners providing funds; the firm name must be that of the liable partners. | Limited partners are liable only up to their contributions; management is prohibited to limited partners (sanction of joint liability). | No detailed regime of units/parts in the excerpts available. | Hybrid form between general partnership and limited partnership. |

**Primary sources (excerpts)**
- SA: articles 29 to 37 (designation, administration, liability of directors and associates, capital and shares, presidential authorization).【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】
- Commandite: articles 23 to 28 (liable partners, limited partners, limited liability of limited partners and prohibition on management).【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

### 1.2 Identified gap

- The Haitian Commercial Code as excerpted above does not provide a modern **limited‑liability vehicle for SMEs**, distinct from the SA (heavy structure and presidential authorization) and the commandite (unlimited exposure for managing partners). This gap is explicit in light of the forms described and their respective requirements in the cited articles.【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

### 1.3 Qualification of the “SME gap”

- **SA**: limited liability but governance by appointed agents and presidential authorization, which raises entry barriers for SMEs.【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】
- **Commandite**: unlimited liability for managing partners and prohibition of management for limited partners, which does not provide uniform protection for SMEs.【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

> Phase 1 conclusion: the existing structure does not provide a simple and accessible limited‑liability company for SMEs, justifying the introduction of a SARL.

## Phase 2 — Comparative SARL synthesis (OHADA, France, Dominican Republic)

### 2.1 Methodological note and limits of access to primary sources

- Primary sources for OHADA/France/Dominican Republic could not be retrieved in this environment at the time of drafting (restricted access to PDF/official portals). **No comparative rule below should be considered verified without the primary texts.**
- **Required action**: complete this section once official texts are available locally (OHADA Uniform Act on Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups; French Commercial Code, Book II, Title II; Dominican law on the SRL).

### 2.2 Comparative table (structure to complete with primary sources)

| Dimension | OHADA (AUSCGIE) | France (Commercial Code, SARL) | Dominican Republic (SRL) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum capital | [to verify in primary text] | [to verify] | [to verify] |
| Number of partners | [to verify] | [to verify] | [to verify] |
| Governance (manager) | [to verify] | [to verify] | [to verify] |
| Transfer of equity interests | [to verify] | [to verify] | [to verify] |
| Accounting/audit | [to verify] | [to verify] | [to verify] |
| Creditor protection | [to verify] | [to verify] | [to verify] |
| Dissolution/Transformation | [to verify] | [to verify] | [to verify] |

### 2.3 Model hypothesis for Haiti (provisional, pending verification)

- In regional practice, the **OHADA structure** is a natural candidate for a Haitian SARL (civil‑law language, article‑based architecture, terminological compatibility with “equity interests,” “manager,” “limited liability”). This hypothesis must be **textually validated** based on the AUSCGIE and compared to French and Dominican mechanisms.

## Next critical action (before Phase 3)

1. Download and archive locally:
   - OHADA Uniform Act on Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups (consolidated version).
   - French Commercial Code (articles L. 223‑1 and following).
   - Dominican law on commercial companies and SRL (e.g., Ley 479‑08 and amendments).
2. Extract key provisions and update the comparative table with **primary citations**.
