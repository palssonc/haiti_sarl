# 1) Comparative legal synthesis report (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

## Phase 1 — Haitian legal baseline (primary sources only)

### 1.1 Current legal forms in the Haitian Commercial Code (Code de commerce haïtien, 1910)

| Form | Governance (excerpts) | Liability | Capital / securities | Key observations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Société anonyme (SA) | Administered by appointed agents, revocable, associates or not, salaried or unpaid. | Associates are liable only up to the amount of their interest in the company. | Capital divided into shares; bearer or registered shares (registry). | Creation requires authorization by the President of Haiti and approval of the constitutive act. | 
| Société en commandite (SNC/commandite) | One or more general partners jointly liable + limited partners providing funds; the firm name must be that of the liable partners. | Limited partners are liable only up to their contributions; management is prohibited to limited partners (sanction of joint liability). | No detailed regime of units/parts in the excerpts available. | Hybrid form between general partnership and limited partnership. |

**Primary sources (excerpts)**
- SA: articles 29 to 37 (designation, administration, liability of directors and associates, capital and shares, presidential authorization).【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】
- Commandite: articles 23 to 28 (liable partners, limited partners, limited liability of limited partners and prohibition on management).【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

### 1.2 Identified gap

- The Haitian Commercial Code as excerpted above does not provide a modern **limited‑liability vehicle for SMEs**, distinct from the SA (heavy structure and presidential authorization) and the commandite (unlimited exposure for managing partners). This gap is explicit in light of the forms described and their respective requirements in the cited articles.【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

### 1.3 Qualification of the “SME gap”

- **SA**: limited liability but governance by appointed agents and presidential authorization, which raises entry barriers for SMEs.【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】
- **Commandite**: unlimited liability for managing partners and prohibition of management for limited partners, which does not provide uniform protection for SMEs.【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

> Phase 1 conclusion: the existing structure does not provide a simple and accessible limited‑liability company for SMEs, justifying the introduction of a SARL.

## Phase 2 — Comparative SARL synthesis (OHADA, France, Dominican Republic)

### 2.1 Methodological note and sources used

- This Phase 2 table is now completed from locally archived legal source notes for each comparator jurisdiction (OHADA, France, Dominican Republic).【F:ohada_auscgie_sarl.txt†L1-L17】【F:france_code_commerce_sarl.txt†L1-L16】【F:dominican_republic_ley_479_08_srl.txt†L1-L17】
- The table below is aligned on core SARL/SRL dimensions needed for Haitian law design.

### 2.2 Comparative table (completed)

| Dimension | OHADA (AUSCGIE) | France (Commercial Code, SARL) | Dominican Republic (SRL) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum capital | No uniform legal minimum; capital is set by the articles of association. | No legal minimum; capital is set by the articles of association. | Legal minimum of RD$ 100,000 for SRL. |
| Number of partners | 1 to 100 partners (single-member SARL possible; transformation if threshold exceeded). | 1 to 100 partners (EURL possible; regularization/transformation if threshold exceeded). | 2 to 50 partners. |
| Governance (manager) | One or more managers, natural persons, partners or non-partners. | One or more managers, natural persons, partners or non-partners. | One or more managers (gerentes), natural persons, appointed by bylaws or shareholders. |
| Transfer of equity interests | Transfer to third parties subject to partner approval (qualified majority). | Transfer to third parties subject to partner approval (at least half of shares unless stricter bylaws). | Transfer to third parties restricted; partner approval with qualified majority (typically 3/4 quotas). |
| Accounting/audit | Annual financial statements; statutory auditor required above legal/regulatory thresholds. | Annual accounts and annual approval; statutory auditor mandatory above thresholds. | Accounting and annual statements required; audit/control required depending on legal thresholds and structure. |
| Creditor protection | Rules on contribution payment, distributions and creditor opposition in capital reduction. | Distributions limited to distributable profits; capital-loss and capital-reduction safeguards for third parties. | Rules on capital integrity, reserves and distributions; manager liability for violations. |
| Dissolution/Transformation | Legal/statutory causes; transformation and dissolution mechanisms including excessive partner count or major losses. | Associate decision under legal majorities; mandatory decision process when equity falls below half of capital. | Statutory/legal grounds for dissolution and formal transformation procedures under company law. |

### 2.3 Model hypothesis for Haiti (provisional, pending verification)

- In regional practice, the **OHADA structure** is a natural candidate for a Haitian SARL (civil‑law language, article‑based architecture, terminological compatibility with “equity interests,” “manager,” “limited liability”). This hypothesis must be **textually validated** based on the AUSCGIE and compared to French and Dominican mechanisms.

## Next critical action (before Phase 3)

1. Validate each quoted rule against the latest official consolidated publications before final legislative drafting.
2. Use the comparative outputs above to calibrate Haitian SARL thresholds (capital, partner limits, governance safeguards).
