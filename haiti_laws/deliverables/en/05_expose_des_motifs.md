# 5) Explanatory memorandum (English)

## 1. Context and objective
Haitian commercial law, as reflected in the 1910 Commercial Code, primarily provides for the public limited company (SA) and the limited partnership (commandite). The SA imposes governance by agents and requires presidential authorization, while the commandite exposes managing partners to joint and several liability and reserves for limited partners a role as capital providers without management. These characteristics make these forms ill‑suited to the growth of small and medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs).【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

The purpose of this law is to create a Haitian Limited Liability Company (SARL), enabling limited liability, simplified governance, and more accessible formalization.

## 2. Need for the reform
- **Entry barriers**: presidential authorization for the SA hinders the rapid formation of companies suited to SMEs.【F:societe_anonyme.txt†L6-L37】
- **Entrepreneurial risk**: the commandite leaves managing partners exposed to unlimited liability, which limits incentives to undertake and formalize.【F:societe_en_nom_commandite.txt†L6-L28】

## 3. Guiding principles
The reform is built on three principles:
1. **Limited liability** of partners up to the amount of contributions.
2. **Simple governance** by one or more managers.
3. **Accessible formation** through clear statutes and rapid registration.

## 4. Expected effects
- Facilitation of business formalization.
- Improved access to credit through legal certainty and asset separation.
- Strengthening of the productive fabric via a corporate form adapted to SMEs.

## 5. Conclusion
The Haitian SARL constitutes a structuring reform compatible with the civil‑law architecture and intended to coexist with existing corporate forms. The proposed law seeks to fill an institutional gap and support formal entrepreneurship in the country.
