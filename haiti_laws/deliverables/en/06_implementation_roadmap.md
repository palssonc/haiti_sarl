# 6) Implementation roadmap for Haiti

## Objective
Operationalize the SARL reform so it is legally usable by SMEs within 6–12 months after enactment.

## A. Administrative rollout steps (0–6 months)
1. **Issue implementing regulations** defining:
   - capital thresholds;
   - audit thresholds;
   - filing templates and registry procedures.
2. **Design standard SARL templates** (statuts types) and publish a plain‑language guide.
3. **Create a single intake channel** at the commercial registry for SARL filings.

## B. Registry and notarial adjustments (0–6 months)
- Update registry workflows to include SARL as a selectable form.
- Train registry officials and notaries on SARL statutory requirements and filings.

## C. Transitional regime for existing firms (6–12 months)
- Allow conversions from existing forms (e.g., commandite) to SARL with simplified filings.
- Require creditor notice and objection windows to protect third parties.

## D. SME communication strategy (3–12 months)
- Launch a public information campaign in partnership with chambers of commerce.
- Provide outreach materials in Haitian Creole and French for SME owners.

## E. Institutional risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Weak registry capacity | Slow adoption | Technical assistance, digitization of filings |
| Low awareness among SMEs | Limited use | Targeted communications, training sessions |
| Legal uncertainty with existing forms | Litigation risk | Clear transitional provisions and registry guidance |

## Milestones
- **Month 1–3**: Draft implementing regulations and templates.
- **Month 4–6**: Registry updates and staff training.
- **Month 7–12**: SME outreach and first conversions.
