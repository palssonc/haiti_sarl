        <h4>Title I — General provisions</h4>
        <h5>Article 1 — Purpose</h5>
        <p>This law establishes the Limited Liability Company (SARL), a commercial company with legal personality, intended for the conduct of economic activities and governed by the provisions below.</p>
        <h5>Article 2 — Commercial nature and legal personality</h5>
        <p>The SARL is commercial by form regardless of its corporate purpose. It acquires legal personality upon registration with the competent trade and company registry.</p>
        <h5>Article 3 — Limited liability</h5>
        <p>Partners’ liability is limited to the amount of their contributions. Partners are not liable on their personal assets for the company’s obligations, subject to provisions on management faults, abuse of rights, and expressly granted personal guarantees.</p>
        <h5>Article 4 — Registered office and name</h5>
        <p>The SARL is formed under a corporate name followed or preceded by the words “Société à responsabilité limitée” or the initials “SARL.” Its registered office is located in Haitian territory.</p>
        <h4>Title II — Formation and statutes</h4>
        <h5>Article 5 — Number of partners</h5>
        <p>The SARL may be formed by one or more persons, natural or legal. The maximum number of partners is one hundred (100).</p>
        <p>Where the number of partners exceeds one hundred (100), the company shall regularize its situation within one (1) year, either by reducing the number of partners or by transforming into another corporate form. Failing regularization, any interested party may petition the competent court for dissolution.</p>
        <h5>Article 6 — Constitutive act</h5>
        <p>The SARL is formed by written statutes, either authentic or private. The statutes shall specify at least:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>the corporate name;</li>
          <li>the corporate purpose;</li>
          <li>the registered office;</li>
          <li>the term, which may not exceed ninety‑nine (99) years, renewable;</li>
          <li>the amount of share capital;</li>
          <li>the identity of partners and allocation of equity interests;</li>
          <li>contribution valuation rules;</li>
          <li>the designation of one or more managers and the scope of their powers, where applicable;</li>
          <li>collective decision-making procedures.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 7 — Registration and legal publication</h5>
        <p>The SARL acquires legal personality upon registration with the competent registry. Registration and legal publication formalities, including filing deadlines and mandatory particulars, are set by decree.</p>
        <h4>Title III — Capital, contributions, and equity interests</h4>
        <h5>Article 8 — Share capital and contributions</h5>
        <p>Share capital is freely set by the statutes. Contributions may be in cash or in kind. Contributions in industry are not included in share capital but may grant rights to profits and voting under conditions set by the statutes.</p>
        <p>Cash contributions shall be paid up for at least one quarter (1/4) of their nominal value upon subscription; the remainder shall be paid within a maximum of two (2) years from registration.</p>
        <h5>Article 9 — Valuation of contributions in kind</h5>
        <p>Contributions in kind shall be valued in the statutes based on a valuation report prepared by an independent contribution appraiser, except where all partners unanimously agree not to appoint one and no contribution in kind exceeds a threshold set by decree.</p>
        <p>Partners are jointly liable to third parties for five (5) years for the valuation assigned to contributions in kind where no appraiser is appointed or where a valuation adopted differs from the appraiser’s report.</p>
        <h5>Article 10 — Registered equity interests and rights attached</h5>
        <p>Equity interests are registered and indivisible vis‑à‑vis the company. They grant each partner rights to profits, voting, and net assets upon liquidation proportionate to their rights in capital, unless this law provides otherwise.</p>
        <h5>Article 11 — Transfer of equity interests</h5>
        <p>Transfers of equity interests to third parties are subject to prior approval by partners representing at least three quarters (3/4) of equity interests, unless the statutes provide a stronger majority.</p>
        <p>Transfers between partners, and transfers to a spouse, ascendants, or descendants of a partner, are free unless the statutes provide an approval clause.</p>
        <p>Any transfer shall be enforceable against the company and third parties only after completion of assignment formalities and publication conditions set by decree.</p>
        <h5>Article 12 — Capital increases and reductions</h5>
        <p>Capital increases and reductions are decided by partners under extraordinary majority conditions provided by Article 18. Capital reductions not motivated by losses may not take effect before expiry of a creditor opposition period set by decree.</p>
        <h4>Title IV — Governance and collective decisions</h4>
        <h5>Article 13 — Management (gérance)</h5>
        <p>The SARL is managed by one or more managers, natural persons, whether partners or not, appointed in the statutes or by collective decision of partners.</p>
        <h5>Article 14 — Powers and representation</h5>
        <p>In relations with third parties, the manager has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the company, within the limits of the corporate purpose and powers expressly attributed by law to partners. Statutory limitations on managers’ powers are unenforceable against third parties acting in good faith.</p>
        <h5>Article 15 — Removal and manager liability</h5>
        <p>A manager may be removed by decision of partners representing more than half (1/2) of equity interests, unless the statutes require a stronger majority. Removal without legitimate cause may give rise to damages.</p>
        <p>Managers are individually or jointly liable, as the case may be, to the company or third parties for legal or regulatory breaches, breaches of statutes, and management faults.</p>
        <h5>Article 16 — Ordinary collective decisions</h5>
        <p>Each partner has at least one vote. Unless otherwise provided by this law, ordinary collective decisions are adopted by one or more partners representing more than half (1/2) of equity interests.</p>
        <p>If this majority is not reached at first consultation, partners are consulted a second time and decisions are adopted by majority of votes cast, regardless of the number of voters, unless the statutes provide otherwise.</p>
        <h5>Article 17 — Extraordinary collective decisions</h5>
        <p>Amendments to statutes are decided by partners representing at least three quarters (3/4) of equity interests, unless this law requires unanimity.</p>
        <p>Any increase in partners’ commitments requires unanimous consent.</p>
        <h5>Article 18 — Minutes and partner information rights</h5>
        <p>Collective decisions are recorded in minutes kept at the registered office and in digital or physical registers identified by decree. Before any decision on annual accounts, partners have the right to receive management reports, financial statements, inventory, and draft resolutions within the period set by decree.</p>
        <h4>Title V — Accounts, profits, and audit</h4>
        <h5>Article 19 — Accounting obligations</h5>
        <p>The SARL keeps regular accounts in accordance with accounting law in force in Haiti and prepares annual financial statements at the close of each financial year.</p>
        <h5>Article 20 — Approval of accounts and allocation of results</h5>
        <p>Within six (6) months of financial year end, partners decide on approval of annual accounts and allocation of results.</p>
        <p>Dividends may be distributed only from distributable profits, after deduction of prior losses and required reserves.</p>
        <p>At least five percent (5%) of annual net profit shall be allocated to a legal reserve until this reserve reaches ten percent (10%) of share capital.</p>
        <h5>Article 21 — Statutory audit</h5>
        <p>One or more statutory auditors are appointed where thresholds for revenue, balance-sheet total, number of employees, or legal control links are met, as set by decree.</p>
        <p>Any partner representing at least ten percent (10%) of equity interests may petition the competent court for appointment of an external expert for one or more management operations.</p>
        <h4>Title VI — Safeguards, transformation, dissolution, and liquidation</h4>
        <h5>Article 22 — Loss of half of share capital</h5>
        <p>If, due to recorded losses, net equity falls below half (1/2) of share capital, managers shall, within four (4) months following approval of accounts showing such losses, consult partners to decide whether early dissolution is required.</p>
        <p>If dissolution is not decided, the company must regularize its position no later than the end of the second financial year following that in which losses were recorded, in accordance with conditions set by decree.</p>
        <h5>Article 23 — Transformation</h5>
        <p>The SARL may be transformed into another corporate form by extraordinary collective decision, without creating a new legal person, subject to compliance with legal requirements specific to the target form.</p>
        <h5>Article 24 — Causes of dissolution</h5>
        <p>The company is dissolved by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>expiry of its term;</li>
          <li>realization or extinction of the corporate purpose;</li>
          <li>early dissolution decided by partners;</li>
          <li>judicial dissolution for legitimate cause;</li>
          <li>any other cause provided by law.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Article 25 — Liquidation</h5>
        <p>In the event of dissolution, liquidation is carried out in accordance with general company law. From dissolution onward, the words “company in liquidation” shall appear on all acts and documents intended for third parties.</p>
        <h4>Title VII — Transitional and final provisions</h4>
        <h5>Article 26 — Transitional conversion regime</h5>
        <p>Existing companies may convert into SARLs under conditions set by decree, without prejudice to acquired rights of creditors and contractual counterparties.</p>
        <h5>Article 27 — Legislative coordination</h5>
        <p>Provisions of the Commercial Code and Haitian commercial legislation contrary to this law are repealed or amended as necessary to ensure coherent coexistence of company forms and legal certainty for economic operators.</p>
        <h5>Article 28 — Implementing decrees</h5>
        <p>Implementing decrees shall specify, as needed, registry formalities, publication rules, thresholds, filing deadlines, and procedural requirements referenced by this law.</p>
        <h5>Article 29 — Entry into force</h5>
